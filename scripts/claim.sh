# Claims for the development routine's overlapping runs: a run writes which
# TODO.md item it is on into the `claims` branch on GitHub, and the other runs
# leave that item alone (.claude/dev-routine.md, 4).
#
#   scripts/claim.sh take <TODO.md line>   claim the item that starts there;
#                                          exit 1 when another run holds it
#   scripts/claim.sh drop                  release this run's claim
#   scripts/claim.sh list                  the claims held now, with their age
#
# Runs start every 15 minutes and a round takes 10 to 20, so a run often
# starts while the one before is still pushing, from a `main` without that
# work. Picking items by position alone collides when an item is added above
# (2026-10-05).
#
# The branch holds one commit with one file, `claims`: a line per claim,
# "<key> <unix time> <item>". Every change replaces that commit with
# `--force-with-lease` naming the commit it read, so of two runs writing at
# once, one is refused, reads again and retries. One branch rather than a
# branch per claim: a cloud session can create branches but not delete them
# (403), and the owner reads the graph in SourceTree. The branch runs no
# workflow (they all build `main` or pull requests only).
#
# The key is a hash of the item's first line, so it survives line numbers
# moving. A claim older than an hour belongs to a run that died, and lapses.
