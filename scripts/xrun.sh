#
#   scripts/xrun.sh OUTDIR [filer arguments...]
#
# Starts its own Xvfb, launches filer with the arguments (`--keys` included),
# waits for the window, and writes into OUTDIR what it shows. With `--keys` it
# waits until filer says the last key has been pressed and has settled
# (FILER_KEYS_DONE, at most XRUN_KEYS_TIMEOUT seconds, default 120), then
# XRUN_WAIT seconds more (default 1) for anything a key started in the
# background. Without `--keys` it waits XRUN_WAIT seconds (default 3). Until
# v0.60.1 it only ever waited XRUN_WAIT, and a script with more `<Wait:N>` in it
# than that was read half-pressed (#134). Writes into OUTDIR:
#
#   shot.png     the whole screen
#   title.txt    the window's title, which names the folder the list is in
#   clip.txt     the clipboard, read while filer still owns it (an X clipboard
#                dies with its owner, so reading it afterwards gets nothing)
#   filer.log    what filer printed
#   keys.done    there when every `--keys` key went in (last line `keys: done`);
#                missing, or `keys: stalled` (v0.67.12), means the script did
#                not finish and the result is of a half-pressed script
#
# The clipboard is armed with XRUN-SENTINEL first, so an unchanged clipboard
# reads as that rather than as the previous run's. FILER_BIN overrides the
# binary (default target/debug/filer). Needs Xvfb, xdotool, xclip, ImageMagick.
